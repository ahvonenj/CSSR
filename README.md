# CSSR

Makes writing CSS-styles with JavaScript in runtime easy.

## Features

* Styles are written with object notation
* Full (or at least 95%) CSS selector support
* Style identification - Applied styles can be tagged with an id for easy removal
* Stylebatching - CSSR batches styles with the same id together, which saves unnecessary style tags
